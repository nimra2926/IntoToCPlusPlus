# CE100: Computing Fundamentals & Programming 

### Instructions:

      • Email instructor or TA in case you are facing any difficulty in writing algorithm of any question.  
      • You cannot look at others’ solution or use others’ solution, however, you can discuss it with each other. 
        Plagiarism will lead to a straight zero with additional consequences as well.
      • Submission after due time will not be accepted.
      • Only working code shall be awarded marks.
      
     

## TASKS

Solve the following and submit the PDF of report containing code and screenshot of output. 

### TASK 1 [25 marks]

Write a program using while loop to print the output as shown below:
      
      1 2 3 4 5
      1 3 5 7 9
      1 4 7 10 13


### TASK 2 [25 marks]

Write a program that inputs a number in main function, and passes that number to a function named as printTable. 
Your function shall print the table of that number using for loop.

### TASK 3 [25 marks]

Write a program that inputs a number and a character in main function, and passes them to a function named as printSquare using for loop. It then displays a square of that entered character against the number of rows user entered.

      e.g if user enter 4 and @, it displays output as follows:

      @@@@
      @@@@
      @@@@
      @@@@


### TASK 4 [25 marks]

Write a function named as printTables that takes a number as parameter and prints tables of three consecutive numbers using nested for loops. 
(e.g if 12 is taken as input then it prints tables of 12, 13 and 14)



### Function prototypes

Function prototype(s) should be written in Functions.h

### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 

### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
