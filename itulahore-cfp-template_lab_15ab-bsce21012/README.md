## QUESTION

1. Write a Python program to reverse the order of the items in the array. <br>
Sample Output:<br>
Original array: array('i', [1, 3, 5, 3, 7, 1, 9, 3])<br>
Reverse the order of the items:<br>
array('i', [3, 9, 1, 7, 3, 5, 3, 1])<br>

<br>


2. Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.<br>
Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)<br>
Expected Output : 20<br>


<br>
 3. Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not. <br>
 Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.<br>

### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
