# CE100: Computing Fundamentals & Programming 

### Instructions:

      • Email instructor or TA in case you are facing any difficulty in writing algorithm of any question.  
      • You cannot look at others’ solution or use others’ solution, however, you can discuss it with each other. 
      • Plagiarism will lead to a straight zero in all previous assignments with additional consequences as well.
      • Code should be yours, not from your internet or any other source.
        If any instance is found copied from an online source, it will be also considered as cheating.
      • Submission after due time will not be accepted.
      • From no onward, heavy penalty will be there for un-indented code and codes with improper comments.
      • Display appropriate input and output messages whether mentioned in question or not.
      • Dry run your solution. It helps in finding out bugs in your program.
     

## REPORT

Submit the PDF of report containing code and screenshot of output. 

### TASKS

Refer to the attached pdf

### Function prototypes

Function prototype(s) should be written in Functions.h

### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 

### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
