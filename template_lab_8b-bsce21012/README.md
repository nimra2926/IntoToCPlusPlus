2.	Write a program to pass two parameters to the function to add a constant value of 100 to the passed values using pointers.

3.	Repeat the task 1 for 2D array.
      
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes
