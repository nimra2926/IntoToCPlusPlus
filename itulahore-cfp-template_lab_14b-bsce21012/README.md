## QUESTION

1. Write a program in C++ for  adding and multiplication of 2D arrays. 
<br>


2. Write a function in C++ which accepts a 2D array of integers and its size as arguments and displays the elements of middle row and the elements of middle column.
[Assuming the 2D Array to be a square matrix with odd dimensions i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 etc...]<br>
Example, if the array contents is<br>
3  5  4<br>
7  6  9<br>
2  1  8<br>
Output through the function should be :<br>
Middle Row : 7 6 9<br>
Middle column : 5 6 1 <br>

<br>
3. Write a user defined function named Upper-half() which takes a two dimensional array A, with size N rows and N columns as argument and prints the upper half of the array.
e.g.,<br>
2 3 1 5 0 <br>                             
7 1 5 3 1   <br>                              
2 5 7 8 1  <br>          
0 1 5 0 1   <br>                                    
3 4 9 1 5  <br><br>                                       
Output will be:<br>
2 3 1 5 0<br>
  1 5 3 1<br>
    1 7 8<br>
      0 1<br>
        5<br>
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
