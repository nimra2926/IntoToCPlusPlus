      Time allowed: 120 minutes 

### Instructions:

      i.   Code must be commented and indented properly.
      ii.  Make sure to push the lab tasks within deadline.
      iii. Anybody found cheating or helping any other person in cheating will get his/her lab cancelled.
      iv.  Submit manual as well. 



## QUESTION

1. Write a C++ program that declares int variables x, y, z and int* pointer variables p, q, r. Set x,<br>
y, z to three different values. Set p, q, r to the addresses of x, y, z respectively.<br>
(1) Print with labels the values of x, y, z, p, q, r, *p, *q, *r.<br>
(2) Print the message: Swapping pointers.<br>
(3) Execute the swap code: r = p; p = q; q = r;<br>
(4) Print with labels the values of x, y, z, p, q, r, *p, *q, *r.
<br>
<br>


2. Write a C++ program for 1D matrix addition and multiplication. 



      
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
