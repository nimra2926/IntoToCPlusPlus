# CE100: Computing Fundamentals & Programming 

      Time allowed: 120 minutes 

### Instructions:

      i.   Code must be commented and indented properly.
      ii.  Make sure to push the lab tasks within deadline.
      iii. Anybody found cheating or helping any other person in cheating will get his/her lab cancelled.
      iv.  Submit manual as well. 



## TASKS

### Task A

Given two variables, we need to swap their values.

e.g Before execution of program: x=5 and y=10 

      After execution of program: x=10 and y=5
 
(a) Write pseudocode 

(b) Draw flowchart

(c) Write C++ program

      
### Task B

Generate Fibonacci Sequence up to a certain number using do while loop.

      The Fibonacci Sequence is such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
                  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
            The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:
            the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
            the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
            the 5 is (2+3),
            and so on!


(a) Write pseudocode 

(b) Draw flowchart

(c) Write C++ program

      
      
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
