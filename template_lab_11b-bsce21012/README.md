## QUESTION

1.	A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations system. You’ve been asked to program the new system. You are to write a program to assign seats on each flight of the airline’s only plane (capacity: 10 seats). <br>
Your program should display the following menu of alternatives—Please type 1 for "First Class" and Please type 2 for "Economy". If the person types 1, your program should assign a seat in the first class section (seats 1– 5).If the person types 2, your program should assign a seat in the economy section (seats 6–10). Your program should print a boarding pass indicating the person’s seat number and whether it’s in the first class or economy section of the plane.<br> 
Your program should, of course, never assign a seat that has already been assigned. When the first class section is full, your program should ask the person if it’s acceptable to be placed in the economy section (and vice versa).If yes, then make the appropriate seat assignment. If no, then print the message "Next flight leaves in 3 hours."<br>



2.	Tomorrow is a holiday on the 14th of august (day of independence of pakistan) . You are planning to go to Joyland but this park is at a considerable distance so you are going to check ticket criteria online .. where you will enter the number of persons going, hours you will stay there and swing you gonna choose furthermore <br>
——> the rates for discovery<br>
children below 10 are not allowed to sit on discovery<br>
10-15(age) wins 10 % discount<br>
15-20 wins 5% discount<br>
while no for above 20<br>
——> the rates for maryland swing<br>
1-5 (age) wins 50 % discount<br>
5-10 25% discount<br>
while no for above <br>
and program will then ask to enter age of person and will run until you enter the age of last family member program will then tell you the amount due after each person’s age you enter parking fee which is 10/hour and price of ticket is PKR 100<br>

3.	A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople each receive $200 per week plus 9 percent of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who grosses $5000 in sales in a week receives $200 plus 9 percent of $5000, or a total of $650. <br>
Write a program (using an array of counters) that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges.<br>
a) $200–299 b) $300–399 c) $400–499 d) $500–599 e) $600–699 f) $700–799 g) $800–899 h) $900–999 i) $1000 and over. <br>
Write the program or 20 salespersons.

      
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
