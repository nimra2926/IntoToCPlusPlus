# CE100: Computing Fundamentals & Programming 

### Instructions:

      • Email instructor or TA in case you are facing any difficulty in writing algorithm of any question.  
      • You cannot look at others’ solution or use others’ solution, however, you can discuss it with each other. 
      • Plagiarism will lead to a straight zero in all previous assignments with additional consequences as well.
      • Code should be yours, not from your internet or any other source.
        If any instance is found copied from an online source, it will be also considered as cheating.
      • Submission after due time will not be accepted.
      • From no onward, heavy penalty will be there for un-indented code and codes with improper comments.
      • Display appropriate input and output messages whether mentioned in question or not.
      • Dry run your solution. It helps in finding out bugs in your program.
     

## REPORT

Solve the following and comment on every step of your algorithm as if you are explaining your code to your fellows to demonstrate clear understanding. 
Submit the PDF of report containing code and screenshot of output. 

### TASK 1 

Write a function that searches for a number in an array and returns the number of times that number appears in the given array. 

      Array: 
      11  7  2  11  11  3

      Search: 11
      Output: 3   // It shows 11 appears 3 times in given array

### TASK 2 

Twenty-five numbers are entered from the keyboard into an array. Write a function to find out how many of them are positive, how many are negative, how many are even and how many are odd. 

      Array: (of size 7 for understanding)

      2  -4  3  10  7  -1  -13

Output:
      
      Odds: 4
      Evens: 3
      Positive: 4 
      Negative: 3


### TASK 3

Create a function that finds and displays the smallest and largest number from the given 2D array. 


### TASK 4

Create a program that checks each element of array and displays whether it’s prime or not.

### TASK 5

Write a program that Reverse Array using pointers.

Sample output:
      
      Original:
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5
      Reverse:
      5, 4, 3, 2, 1

### TASK 6

Write a program to Sort Array using pointers.

Sample output:

      Original:
      21, 2, 13, 40, 5
      Reverse:
      2, 5, 13, 21, 40



### Function prototypes

Function prototype(s) should be written in Functions.h

### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 

### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
