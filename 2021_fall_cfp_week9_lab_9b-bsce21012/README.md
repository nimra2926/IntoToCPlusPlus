2. Write a program to reverse the elements of an array using pointers.<br>
void reverseArrayElements (int * , int); <br>
Before reversing array, elements of array are: [7 8 9 11 ]<br>
After reversing array, elements of array are: [11 9 8 7 ]<br>


3. Repeat the task 1 using recursion



      
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
