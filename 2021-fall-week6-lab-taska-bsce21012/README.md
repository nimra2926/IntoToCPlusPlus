Take 4 coordinates of the Rectangle and a point P. Your program should be able to tell whether P lies inside the Rectangle or Not.

Sample Input:  	
            
            P1	0 0
		P2	2 0
		P3	2 2
		P4	0 2
		P	1 1

Output: 

      P lies inside Square


### Task A

Write pseudocode 

### Task B

Draw flowchart

### Task C

Write C++ program

      

      
      
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
