# CE100: Computing Fundamentals & Programming 

### Instructions:

      • Email instructor or TA in case you are facing any difficulty in writing algorithm of any question.  
      • You cannot look at others’ solution or use others’ solution, however, you can discuss it with each other. 
      • Plagiarism will lead to a straight zero in all previous assignments with additional consequences as well.
      • Code should be yours, not from your internet or any other source.
        If any instance is found copied from an online source, it will be also considered as cheating.
      • Submission after due time will not be accepted.
      • From no onward, heavy penalty will be there for un-indented code and codes with improper comments.
      • Display appropriate input and output messages whether mentioned in question or not.
      • Dry run your solution. It helps in finding out bugs in your program.
     

## REPORT

Solve the following and comment on every step of your algorithm as if you are explaining your code to your fellows to demonstrate clear understanding. 
Submit the PDF of report containing code and screenshot of output. 

## TASK

Write a user-interactive menu-driven C++ program 

      Enter your option for the shape type (1 to 8 or E to exit):
      
      1) Reads 10 numbers from the user 
      2) Task 2
      3) Task 3
      4) Task 4
      E) Exit

### Task 1

Write a C++ program that reads 10 numbers from the user, stores them into an array, 


### Task 2
Prints the largest, smallest number, and the sum of all the numbers on the screen.

### Example:
If the User enters 11, 2, 15, 34, 18, 2, 15, 18, 15, 50 then program should 

print: Largest = 50, Smallest = 2 and SUM = 180



### Task 3
Print the sum of odd and even number.


### Example:
If the user enters 11, 2, 15, 34, 18, 2, 15, 18, 15, 50 then the program should 

print: Sum of even numbers = and Sum of odd numbers


### Task 4
Print the count of numbers that are perfect squares


### Example:
If the user enters 11, 4, 15, 9, 18, 2, 25, 18, 15, 49 then program should 

print: There are 4 perfect squares




### Function prototypes

Function prototype(s) should be written in Functions.h

### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 

### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
