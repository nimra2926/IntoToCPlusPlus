## QUESTION

1. Write a C++ code to print a string character by character using pointers.<br>
Input: Enter string: Pakistan<br>
Output: Pakistan


2. Write a C++ code to get size and array elements from the user and print the array and sum of array elements using pointers.<br>
Input:<br>
How many numbers do you want to add? : 3<br>
Enter 1st element: 5<br>
Enter 2nd element: 6<br>
Enter 2nd element: 10<br>
Output:<br>
Elements of array are: [5 6 10 ]<br>
Sum of all elements of array using Pointers as Parameters: 21


3. Write a C++ code to swap two values using pointers through a function named “SwapValues”.<br>
void swapValues ( float *, float * );<br>
Before swapping x = 10.8 and y = 20<br>
After swapping x = 20 and y = 10.8

      
### Functions

Function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
