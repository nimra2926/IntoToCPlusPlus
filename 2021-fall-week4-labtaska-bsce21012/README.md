# CE100: Computing Fundamentals & Programming 

      Time allowed: 45 minutes 

### Instructions:

      i.   Code must be commented and indented properly.
      ii.  Make sure to push the lab tasks within deadline.
      iii. Anybody found cheating or helping any other person in cheating will get his/her lab cancelled.
      iv.  Submit manual as well. 


## TASKS

### Task A

Write a program in C++ to calculate the sum of the following series:

`(1*1) + (2*2) + (3*3) + (4*4) + (5*5) + ... + (n*n)` 

      Sample Output:
      Input the value for nth term: 5
      1*1 = 1
      2*2 = 4
      3*3 = 9
      4*4 = 16
      5*5 = 25
      The sum of the above series is: 55

### Task B

Write a program in C++ to find the sum of the following series:

`1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ..+ 1/n^n` 

      Sample Output:
      Input the value for nth term: 5
      1/1^1 = 1
      1/2^2 = 0.25
      1/3^3 = 0.037037
      1/4^4 = 0.00390625
      1/5^5 = 0.00032
      The sum of the above series is: 1.29126


      
### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 

`make test` This will run test.cpp executable


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
