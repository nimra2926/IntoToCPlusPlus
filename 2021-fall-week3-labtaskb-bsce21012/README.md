# CE100: Computing Fundamentals & Programming 

      Time allowed: 45 minutes 

### Instructions:

      i.   Code must be commented and indented properly.
      ii.  Make sure to push the lab tasks within deadline.
      iii. Anybody found cheating or helping any other person in cheating will get his/her lab cancelled.
      iv.  Submit manual as well. 


## TASKS

### Task A

Write a program to calculate the sum of first ten odd numbers.

Your function must look like this:

      int printUsingWhileLoop(){
      int sum = 0;
      // Write your code here
      return sum; // returns the variable that stored the sum
      }

### Task B

Write a program to find out the factorial of an integer. 

Formula to find the factorial of an integer is: `n*(n-1)*(n-2)* ... *(-1)`

Your function must look like this:

      int factorialUsingWhileLoop(int num){
      int fac=1;
      // Write your code here
      return fac; // returns the variable that stored the factorial
      }

      
      
### Additional Functions

Additional function(s) should be written in Functions.cpp and used in main.cpp


### Run command

`make run`  This will run main.cpp executable 

`make test` This will run test.cpp executable


### Notes

- `g++` can be used to compile and link C++ applications for use with existing test harnesses or other C++ testing frameworks.
- You should use C++ standard approach for the development, using g++ extensions is not acceptable
